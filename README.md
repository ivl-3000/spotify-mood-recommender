# Spotify – Mood & Context-Aware Playlist Recommender (Project)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is a **6-month Data Science Project Showcase** focused on building a  
**Mood & Context-Aware Playlist Recommender System** for Spotify.  

The project combines **NLP, Machine Learning, LLMs, SQL, and Power BI** to recommend playlists  
based on **lyrics, social media sentiment, and user context**.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?
Music is deeply connected to emotions and context.  
Traditional recommenders use collaborative filtering (user-item interactions).  
This project enhances recommendations by adding **mood detection** from:
- Song lyrics 🎵  
- Social media posts 💬  
- User context (time, mood, activity) ⏰  

---

## 🛠️ Skills Highlighted
- **NLP & LLMs:** Mood detection using BERT/LLMs from lyrics & social data.  
- **Machine Learning:** Hybrid recommender (collaborative + content-based + mood-aware).  
- **SQL & Data Engineering:** Building ETL pipelines for Spotify, lyrics & social data.  
- **Visualization:** Power BI dashboard (genre trends, mood shifts, personalization).  
- **Deployment:** Flask/FastAPI + AWS/GCP deployment of recommender API.
